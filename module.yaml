    Attention!

    Disabling this module will stop controllers maintaining GPU inventory and bootstrap resources.
    Before disabling the module, make sure that GPU workloads are drained, NodeFeatureRule manifests are no longer needed
    and GPU-specific policies are cleaned up. Removing the module without cleanup may leave stale GPUDevice objects and
    orphan resources in the cluster.
